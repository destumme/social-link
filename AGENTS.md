# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.
<!-- END:nextjs-agent-rules -->

# Guidelines

- Prefer simple over complex.
- Keep changes small and incremental.
- Only make changes that are confirmed.
- Use the `todowrite` tool to create todo checklists for any plan with 3+ steps before starting implementation.

# Project

Social links app — Next.js 16.2.6 + GraphQL Yoga + Prisma 7 + Better Auth + PostgreSQL.

## Commands

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Dev server | `yarn dev` |
| Production build | `yarn build` |
| Lint | `yarn lint` (eslint, no separate typecheck script — build runs TS) |
| Prisma generate | `yarn run prisma generate` |
| DB push (dev) | `yarn run prisma db push` |
| Seed DB | `yarn run prisma db seed` |

Package manager is **yarn 4.14.1** (`packageManager` field). Use `yarn`, not `npm install`.
Use `yarn run prisma` for Prisma CLI commands (not `npx`). If a `yarn run` command fails, do not retry — report the error instead.

## Skills

Always check if an available skill applies before starting work. Load the relevant skill via the `skill` tool when its trigger conditions are met.

| Skill | When to use |
|---|---|
| `better-auth-best-practices` | Configuring Better Auth server/client, database adapters, sessions, plugins, env vars |
| `create-auth-skill` | Scaffolding auth with Better Auth — login, sign-up, OAuth, auth UI pages |
| `customize-opencode` | Editing opencode config (`opencode.json`, `.opencode/`, agents, skills, MCP servers) |
| `graphql-schema` | Designing or reviewing GraphQL schemas, types, nullability, pagination, errors, security |
| `next-best-practices` | Next.js patterns — file conventions, RSC boundaries, data patterns, metadata, route handlers |
| `prisma-client-api` | Writing Prisma queries — CRUD, filters, operators, `$transaction`, client configuration |
| `shadcn` | Working with shadcn/ui components, component registry, styling, presets |

## Documentation

When tasked with a bug or feature, check the relevant tracker — each entry includes agent-facing instructions.

- **[Bug tracker](docs/bugs/index.md)** — each bug file has an `## Agent Instructions` section with `What to look for`, `Files to check`, `What not to change`, and `Verification`. See index for [Creating a New Bug](docs/bugs/index.md).
- **[Feature tracker](docs/features/index.md)** — each feature spec has an `## Agent Instructions` section with the same directives. See index for [Creating a New Feature](docs/features/index.md).
